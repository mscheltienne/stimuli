==============
Apply a window
==============

.. include:: ../../links.inc

In signal processing and statistics, a window function (also known as an
apodization function or tapering function) is a mathematical function that is
zero-valued outside of some chosen interval, normally symmetric around the
middle of the interval, usually near a maximum in the middle, and usually
tapering away from the middle. Mathematically, when another function or
waveform/data-sequence is "multiplied" by a window function, the product is
also zero-valued outside the interval: all that is left is the part where they
overlap, the "view through the window".

A sound waveform might have an abrupt onset or offset. It is often preferred to
apply a window to ramp up and ramp down the volume.

In this tutorial, we will create a pure tone auditory stimuli and apply a
window with a linear ramp-up and a linear ramp-down to smooth the onset and
offset.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-45

Create a pure tone
------------------

To create the stimuli, we create a :class:`~stimuli.audio.Tone` object with
a given volume and frequency.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-48

.. code-block:: Python


    sound = Tone(frequency=200, volume=10, duration=0.1)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 49-52

By default, a generated signal will have a rectangular window applied. A
recctangular window is equal to 0 outside of the signal definition range, and
to 1 inside. We can plot the waveform of one of the channels:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-70

.. code-block:: Python


    # draw the waveform
    _, ax = sound.plot()
    ax.set_title("Waveform - Rectangular window")

    # overlay a rectangular window
    # note: for demonstration purposes, we make the window 20% longer than the
    # signal by extending it by 10% before and after the signal.
    extension = int(0.1 * sound.times.size)
    window = np.zeros(extension + sound.times.size + extension)
    window[extension + 1 : extension + sound.times.size] = 1 / sound.volume
    # determine the timestamps associated to each sample in the window (ms)
    window_times = np.arange(0, 1 / sound.sample_rate * window.size, 1 / sound.sample_rate)
    window_times -= extension / sound.sample_rate
    # draw the window
    ax.plot(window_times, window, color="crimson")
    plt.show()

Create a different window
-------------------------

For this tutorial, we will define a window with a ramp from ``0`` to ``1``
during the first 10% of the total duration, and a ramp from ``1`` to ``0``
during the last 10% of the total duration. A correctly defined window is a
1D `~numpy.array` with the same number of samples as the sound.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-85

.. code-block:: Python


    window = np.ones(sound.times.size)
    n_samples_ramp = int(0.1 * sound.times.size)
    ramp = np.linspace(start=0, stop=1, num=n_samples_ramp)
    window[:n_samples_ramp] = ramp
    window[-n_samples_ramp:] = ramp[::-1]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 86-90

Change the window
-----------------

We can change the applied window by setting the property ``window``.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-99

.. code-block:: Python


    sound.window = window

    # draw the modified sound and the window
    _, ax = sound.plot()
    ax.set_title("Waveform - Ramp onset/offset window")
    ax.plot(sound.times, window / sound.volume, color="crimson")  # overlay the window
    plt.show()

Scipy windows
-------------

`scipy`_ has many windows implemented in :mod:`scipy.signal.windows`. For instance
we can use a Tukey window with the function `~scipy.signal.windows.tukey`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 105-114

.. code-block:: Python


    window = tukey(sound.times.size)
    sound.window = window

    # draw the modified sound and the window
    _, ax = sound.plot()
    ax.set_title("Waveform - Tukey window")
    ax.plot(sound.times, window / sound.volume, color="crimson")  # overlay the window
    plt.show()
