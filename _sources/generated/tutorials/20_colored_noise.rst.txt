=============
Colored noise
=============

A noise signal is produced by a stochastic process. The color of noise, also
called the noise spectrum, refers to the power spectrum of a noise signal.

The practice of naming kinds of noise after colors started with white noise,
a signal whose spectrum has equal power within any equal interval of
frequencies. That name was given by analogy with white light, which was
(incorrectly) assumed to have such a flat power spectrum over the visible
range. Other color names, such as ``pink``, ``red``, and ``blue`` were then
given to noise with other spectral profiles, often (but not always) in
reference to the color of light with similar spectra. Some of those names
have standard definitions in certain disciplines, while others are very
informal and poorly defined.

In this tutorial, we will create and plot the power spectrum of different
noise colors. ``stimuli`` implements several noise color in
:class:`~stimuli.audio.Noise`. Refer to the documentation of the ``color``
argument for available colors.

    colors = ("white", "pink", "blue", "violet", "brown")
    sounds = dict()
    for color in colors:
        # identical volume on all audio channels
        sounds[color] = Noise(color=color, volume=10, duration=1)

We can listen to each individual noise by playing each sound with
:meth:`~stimuli.audio.Noise.play`.

The underlying signal is stored in the :py:attr:`stimuli.audio.Noise.signal`
property, a numpy :class:`~numpy.ndarray` of shape ``(n_samples, n_channels)``. In
this case, the sound was set to mono so the signal has shape ``(n_samples, 1)``.
