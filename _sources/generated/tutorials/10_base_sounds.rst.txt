===========
Base sounds
===========

``stimuli`` provides a common API for audio stimuli. The audio
stimuli can be either generated or loaded. A generated stimuli can be exported.
The volume, duration and other properties can be set when creating the stimuli
or updated between plays.

    from stimuli.audio import Sound, Tone









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-29

In this tutorial, we will create, edit, save and load a pure tone auditory
stimuli. A pure tone is a signal with a sinusoidal waveform, that is a sine
wave of any frequency, phase-shift and amplitude.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-37

Create and edit a pure tone
---------------------------

To create the stimuli, we create a :class:`~stimuli.audio.Tone` object with
a given volume and frequency.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 37-40

.. code-block:: Python


    sound = Tone(frequency=440, volume=10, duration=0.1)  # La - A440








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 41-42

We can listen to the sound we created with :meth:`~stimuli.audio.Tone.play`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-45

.. code-block:: Python


    sound.play(blocking=True)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-48

We can edit the sound properties by replacing the value in the properties.
For instance, let's increase the volume and change the frequency.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-52

.. code-block:: Python


    sound.volume = 50  # percentage between 0 and 100
    sound.frequency = 1000  # Hz








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-54

The sound is updated each time an attribute is changed.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-57

.. code-block:: Python


    sound.play(blocking=True)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-63

Export/Load a sound
-------------------

We can export a sound with :meth:`~stimuli.audio.Tone.save` and load a sound with
:class:`~stimuli.audio.Sound`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-70

.. code-block:: Python


    with TemporaryDirectory() as directory:
        fname = Path(directory) / "my_pure_tone.wav"
        sound.save(fname, overwrite=True)
        sound_loaded = Sound(fname)
    sound_loaded.play(blocking=True)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 71-75

However, a loaded sound can be any type of sound. ``stimuli`` does not
know that the sound was exported with the ``save()`` method of one of its
class. As such, the attributes that were specific to the original sound are
not present anymore and can not be updated anymore.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 75-78

.. code-block:: Python


    print(hasattr(sound_loaded, "frequency"))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    False




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-80

Only the basic attributes are preserved: ``duration``, ``sample_rate``.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 80-86

.. code-block:: Python


    print(f"Duration of the original sound: {sound.duration} second.")
    print(f"Duration of the loaded sound: {sound_loaded.duration} second.")
    print(f"Sample rate of the original sound: {sound.sample_rate} Hz.")
    print(f"Sample rate of the loaded sound: {sound_loaded.sample_rate} Hz.")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Duration of the original sound: 0.1 second.
    Duration of the loaded sound: 0.1 second.
    Sample rate of the original sound: 44100 Hz.
    Sample rate of the loaded sound: 44100 Hz.




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-89

The volume is normalized, with the loudest channel set to ``100``. The ratio
between channels is preserved.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 89-93

.. code-block:: Python


    print(f"Volume of the original sound: {sound.volume}.")
    print(f"Volume of the loaded sound: {sound_loaded.volume}.")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Volume of the original sound: [50.].
    Volume of the loaded sound: [100.].

Visualize a sound
-----------------

Finally, the underlying signal is stored in the ``signal`` property, a numpy array of
shape ``(n_samples, n_channels)``. We can plot the signal of each channel.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 99-118

.. code-block:: Python


    samples_to_plot = 100  # number of samples to plot
    times = sound.times[:samples_to_plot] * 1000  # ms

    f, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, layout="constrained")
    ax.plot(times, sound.signal.squeeze()[:samples_to_plot])  # draw data
    ax.axhline(0, color="black")  # draw horizontal line through y=0

    # labels
    ax.set_title("Signal (mono)")
    ax.set_xlabel("Time (ms)")

    # draw vertical line after each period
    period = int(sound.sample_rate / sound.frequency)
    for k in range(0, samples_to_plot, period):
        ax.axvline(times[k], color="lightgreen")

    plt.show()
